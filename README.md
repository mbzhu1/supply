# about

Supply is an iOS application that enables users to donate and request essential items from their local community. 

**Note:** There is an updated version of this application with Firebase Authentication at https://github.com/jojo39381/supply

# why

COVID19 has created a shortage of essential supplies such as masks, hand sanitizer, and even toilet paper. The current system of distributing these items to those is need is extremely inefficient. Often, individuals in need may rely on donations from an organization, and then that organization relies on donations from other individuals and so on. 

The inefficiencies of this distribution chain leaves holes where some people lack supplies they desperately need while others have too much of that same item. Our application fills the gaps created by bureaucracy by enabling individuals to directly donate to other individuals

# how it works

**2.5min video walkthrough with voiceover: https://youtu.be/WqlYebiv6cA**

A user can sign up or log in with an existing account on our iOS application. 

Note: During login, the keyboard may not dismiss unless you click the "return" button.  Also, Camera functionalities does not work. Choose image from album instead.

     width = "250"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

The home page shows a feed of donations and requests.

     alt="open with xcode image" 
     width = "250"

     alt="open with xcode image" 
     width = "250"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

When clicked, the listing will display specific information about the item, quantity, and pickup location.

     alt="open with xcode image"

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

The user can make a new listing and choose between a request and donation

     alt="open with xcode image" 
     width = "250"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
     
The new listing will be reflected on the home page and on the users profile

**Note:** the current version of the app doesn't support the camera

**Hardware:** works best on iPhone 7 and above

# tech stack

We built the **iOS** application using **Swift** and **Xcode**.

For the UI design, we implemented a combination of **UIKit** and **SwithUI** views.

The login authentication is powered by **Firebase**.

The database is implemented in **Firestore** (currently in progress).

The [landing page](https://supply-website.vercel.app/) was made using **React** and is hosted on **Vercel**

Our wireframes and color palette are documented in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ZKLx5jHVJ6YfWGg2PPETNv/Supply)


# [future plans](https://youtu.be/ZreE2mAUVVE)
1. **Direct Messaging:** Allow direct messaging between donors and requesters within the app rather than just sharing contact info

2. **International shipping:** Implement shipping and tracking so that users can donate anywhere in the world, not just their local community

3. **Support organizations:** Develop inventory and logistics management for large donors or organizations

4. **Social awards:** Implement donation stats and achievements to promote social engagement

5. **Crowdfunding:** Allow for group donations and requests to enable crowdfunding-like activity

6. **Emergency support:** Enable fulfillment of time-sensitive requests
